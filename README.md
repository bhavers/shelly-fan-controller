# shelly-fan-controller
This project controls the bathroom fan based on the amount of humidty.

The main file is: fan-controller.mjs. This script runs on the Shelly plus 1PM.
It takes input from a Shelly H&T that measures the humidity in the bathroom.
The Shelly Plus 1PM is configured as a momentary switch that keeps running for 30 minutes once pressed.

I think i have used code from the [shelly-script-examples](https://github.com/ALLTERCO/shelly-script-examples).
